This is a portable implementation of the format used in the password safe application.

It is written by Noa Resare (noa@resare.com) and released using the GPLv3 license.

WARNING: this is early work in progress, it only implements reading. Doesn't free
allocated memory properly. From now, please stay away from it!

The design goal of this implementation is that it should be limited in it's dependencies
on other libraries, more specifically it includes code for all cryptographic functionality
it needs.

This code was written based on the format specification available in the file formatv3.txt from
pwsafe-3.26-src.zip available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/passwordsafe

The following third party code is included in this distribution. To the best of my knowledge,
the code included has a license compatible with GPLv3. If you believe this to be in error,
please do not hesitate to contact me and I will do my best to sort this out.
